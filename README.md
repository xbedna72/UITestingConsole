This project was made as a practical part of thesis: *GUI Test Development Support Tool*

**Abstract**

Manual testing of application is very effective, but at the same time very time consuming
process. This thesis will deal with methods and technologies, which would allow computers
to not only record and rerun the process without the human assistence or intervention but
also make an outcome of this process, which will be in form of report with results of the
task run. In the final solution the method of testing was chosen based on the knowledge
of application. Within this thesis the design of framework was created with the help of the
WinAppDriver technology, which is able to execute the recorded methods as test runs
during which the informations about the process itself are being collected. The final report
is made, based on the collected information. The outcome of this thesis is a pair of tools,
which can automatically execute specifically designed GUI application tests. There were
simultaneously included actions, which are necessary to perform before executing the tests.
Therefore the program will be able to operate without the need of human assistance.
